## \[ Yes\! The Transparent Rectangle Form Animation \] \- V1


</div>

### Description

This code is nicely implimented form animation which is so powerful to have the same performance of the 'Microsoft Word's' animation. The different options can control the animation-speed/frames/time/borderwidth/bordercolor and even the CPU load. It works on simple idea and I think you all like this. Enjoy! and please leave your valid comments.
